            Iâ€™m a Final Year Computer Engineering Student passionate about
            Developer Community Building & creating impacts through building
            relationships, delivering Events and Community Programs with
            Developer Advocacy. It has been about three years since I started my
            journey around Communities & my passion has always pushed me more to
            bring people together to drive Advocacy and Adoption efficiencies.
            With this enthusiasm, I have been leading a bunch of Communities for
            Developers such as IEEE Student Branch, Google Developer Student
            Club, Google Developers Group, and IEEE India Council Industry
            Relations Team.
