                  Iâ€™m a Final Year Computer Engineering Student passionate about
                  Developer Community Building & creating impacts through
                  building relationships, delivering Events and Community
                  Programs with Developer Advocacy. It has been about three
                  years since I started my journey around Communities & my
                  passion has always pushed me more to bring people together to
                  drive Advocacy and Adoption efficiencies. With this
                  enthusiasm, I have been leading a bunch of Communities for
                  Developers such as IEEE Student Branch, Google Developer
                  Student Club, Google Developers Group, and IEEE India Council
                  Industry Relations Team.
